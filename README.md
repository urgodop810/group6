### pass_graph.ipynb

This considers all the passes made by Barcelona in the season. To turn this into a graph, it creates a list of nodes from all the different players who made passes. Each directed edge represents a each unique combination combination between players. The weight of the edge is calculated from the number of passes made along it. Centrality measures are applied to the graph to calculate which players are most important for passing. This also outputs the results to player_centralities.xlsx.
